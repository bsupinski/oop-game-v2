TreeHouse Full Stack Tech Degree Project #4

This is a project designed to test understanding OOP with classes in JavaScript.

Goal is to have a Phrase class that takes a string and sets it as square that hides it's text content from the user. It will also have a method that shows a guessed letter when called.

The Game class creates the phrase to be guessed from an array of Phrase objects. On the interaction of a keydown event or click on a gui keyboard it will do a few things. The interaction will highlight on the gui keyboard what is a right or wrong guess, and disable the gui letter and keyboard key on a guessed letter. It will also increase a missed guess, and per a miss a life hear will be displayed with a loss heart img. On a correct guess the letters in the phrase will be shown. Once all letters are guessed or the missed counter gets to five the win or loss screen will show. The user can then play again, a new phrase will be picked, and the settings set back to default.

Adjusted CSS included
-Main start screen given a radial-gradient
-Start button given a hover scale increase change and drop shadow.
-Start button active scales it back to default.
-Main game background color changed
-Right and wrong guesses background color changed
-Hearts given some gap between them
